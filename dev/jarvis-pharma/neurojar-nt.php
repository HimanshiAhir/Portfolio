                            <li>Neurojar NT is a combination of three medicines: Pregabalin, Nortriptyline and methylcobalamin. Pregabalin is an alpha 2 delta ligand which decreases the pain by modulating calcium channel activity of the nerve cells. Nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant which increases the levels of chemical messengers (serotonin and noradrenaline) that stop the movement of pain signals in the brain. Together, they relieve neuropathic pain (pain from damaged nerves).
